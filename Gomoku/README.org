* About
You can simply edit the variables in the script.js file with your AI server info and use the frontend to see the AIs fight!
#+begin_src js
  const PLAYER1_INFO = {
      "server_address": "http://localhost:3000/ai/solve",
      "name": "Stanform",
      "piece": BLACK,
      "color": "Black",
      "logo": "./resources/stanform-logo.webp"
  };

  const PLAYER2_INFO = {
      "server_address": "http://localhost:3000/ai/solve",
      "name": "Knights",
      "piece": WHITE,
      "color": "White",
      "logo": "./resources/knight-logo.jpg"
  };
#+end_src

* How to create your endpoint?
All AIs communicate using RESTful protocol. All AIs must have the following endpoint.
#+begin_src js
  app.post("/ai/solve", (req, res)=>{
      let state = req.body.state;
      let player = req.body.player;
      game.setPlayerRole(player);

      res.status(200).send({"state":state});
  });
#+end_src

Here, ~state~ is the state of the gomoku board after each ply/move. So your endpoint should take a gomoku board, decide its move and return the gomoku board with its move placed.


And thats it! You are ready to fight the legendary war of AIs.
